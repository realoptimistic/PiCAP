Signals Intelligence is the backbone of every intelligence gathering operationand offers high value information from restricted networks. 
For a rewarding mission a successful network intrusion is always the first step for further access to the
target system. With an increasingly mobile and flexible world, networks are more
and more required to enable wireless connectivity. Although wireless connectivity
allows detection and less restricted access than wired connections these networks
must not always be within reach. Even the earliest reconnaissance can be hindered
by restricted perimeters or bad performing targeted Access Points with suboptimal
signal gain.

These problems call for small and versatile unmanned aerial vehicles with an
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance payload. With a fast pace in development of communication standards and lighter more versatile field personal
an Open-Source and unclassified platform offers a broader and inexpensive signal
gathering tool with shorter iteration time from development to deployment. Small,
self-contained, and inexpensive nodes enable a broader and high-density deployment compared to other solutions on the market. More nodes create a more reliant
infrastructure increasing the chance of a successful penetration of security perimeters.
